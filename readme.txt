Create an administrative interface allowing administrators to upload assets (such as images) to a page or post. The current version is a developer-centric plugin and is not recommended for users not comfortable editing page templates. I do hope to update the plugin in the future to add short-code placement of the asset listings.

== Description ==

This plugin will create an "Asset Manager" panel on the page/post admin interface allowing administrators to upload files that are related to that post. You are then able to retrieve these assets within the page template as needed.
	
== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page. 

After activating the plugin, a meta panel will be displayed on the Page and Post pages in the WP admin area.

You may then use the following functions to pull these assets anywhere within your template:

paam_get_all_assets() - retrieve all assets uploaded to any/all posts.
paam_get_assets($post_id) - retrieve assets specific to a specific page/post
